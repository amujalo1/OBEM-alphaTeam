## Project Overview
The application is designed to provide building managers, residents, and maintenance teams with tools to monitor, manage, and optimize energy consumption in multi-unit buildings. The system addresses several key use cases to promote energy efficiency, cost transparency, and sustainability.

---

## Use Cases

### 1. **Unit-Level Energy Monitoring**
   - **Description**: Building managers and residents can track energy consumption for individual units or apartments.
   - **Purpose**: Identify high-usage areas and encourage energy-saving practices.

### 2. **Peak Energy Demand Management**
   - **Description**: Building administrators can monitor and manage energy demand during peak hours.
   - **Purpose**: Avoid excessive costs and reduce strain on local grids.

### 3. **Anomaly Detection in Energy Use**
   - **Description**: Maintenance teams receive alerts for abnormal energy usage patterns (e.g., sudden spikes due to faulty appliances or devices left running).
   - **Purpose**: Quickly investigate and resolve issues to prevent energy waste.

### 4. **Energy Cost Allocation**
   - **Description**: Property managers can allocate energy costs to each unit or apartment based on actual usage.
   - **Purpose**: Ensure transparency and accountability in energy billing.

### 5. **Sustainability Monitoring**
   - **Description**: Sustainability teams gain insights into the building's overall carbon footprint and receive recommendations for energy-saving initiatives (e.g., smart thermostats, better insulation).
   - **Purpose**: Promote sustainable practices and reduce environmental impact.
